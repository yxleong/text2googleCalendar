# Explanation of the Code

The code above is a Python script that creates an event in a Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.

## Import Required Libraries
The script starts by importing the os, json, google.auth, googleapiclient.discovery, and googleapiclient.errors libraries.

## Define the Text to be Converted into a Calendar Event
A string variable named `text` is defined, which contains the text that will be converted into a calendar event.

## Define the Calendar ID
A string variable named `calendar_id` is defined, which specifies the ID of the calendar in which the event will be created. The ID is set to `"primary"`, which means that the event will be created in the primary calendar associated with the Google account.

## Authenticate and Construct the Calendar API Client
The `google.auth.default()` function is used to authenticate the user and retrieve the credentials, which are then passed as an argument to the `build()` function to construct the Calendar API client.

## Extract the Event Details from the Text
A dictionary named `event_details` is created, which will contain the details of the event to be created. The `event_details` dictionary is populated with the event summary, description, start time, and end time.

## Create the Event
The `insert()` method of the Calendar API client is used to create the event in the calendar, by passing the calendar ID and the event details as arguments.

## Print the Event Details
Finally, the script prints the details of the event that was created, including the event summary and start time.
